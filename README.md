# Intrinsic Triangulations in Rust

In this repo is code I wrote following along with the [Nicholas Sharp](https://nmwsharp.com/), [Mark Gillespie](https://markjgillespie.com/), [Keenan Crane](http://keenan.is/here)'s [course on geometry processing with intrinsic triangulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcRDdYrgOhg). Also check out the [course repo](https://github.com/nmwsharp/intrinsic-triangulations-tutorial), which has more detailed comments.

To visualize the results (requires numpy and polyscope), run:
```shell
cargo run --release
```
*note:* on MacOS using `pyenv` this might not run due to using `inline-python`.
